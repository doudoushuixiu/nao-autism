nao-autism
==========

Repo for the Nao robot autism project.

Things to do
------------

+ Put in speech/behavior for asking to change players
+ Find/make a behavior to go with this
+ Adjust pocketsphinx language model to work with english accents (if too difficult, just map 'scared' to 'yes', seems to get that every time)
+ Perhaps tune the SVM to make scared pose more accurate
+ Add 'Prompts' to settings for mimic game
+ Make GUI for running the nodes/diagnostics
+ Write documentation
+ Make sure mimicker sits/stands properly
